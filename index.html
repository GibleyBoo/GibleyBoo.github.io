                    <p>
                        As the first sign in the zodiac, the presence of Aries almost always marks the beginning of something energetic and turbulent.They are continuously looking for dynamic, speed and competition. They are always first in everything - from work to social gatherings.
                        Thanks to its ruling planet Mars, Aries is one of the most active zodiac signs. People born under the Aries sign, are meant to emphasize the search for answers to personal and metaphysical questions. This is the biggest feature
                        of this incarnation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aries is a fire sign, just like Leo and Sagittarius. This means that it is in their nature to take action, sometimes before they think about it well. Their fiery ruler affects their excellent organizational skills, so you'll rarely meet an Aries who doesn't
                        like to finish more things at once, often even before the lunch break! The challenges are increased when they are impatient, aggressive and vent anger on others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aries rules the head and leads with the head, often literally walking head first, leaning forwards for speed and focus. They are naturally brave and rarely afraid of trial and risk. They possess youthful strength and energy, regardless of age and they
                        perform tasks in record time. By aligning with themselves they could achieve the best results.

                        tactile. Touch is extremely important for them, both in business and in romance. Stable and conservative, Taurus is among the most reliable signs of the zodiac. Stubbornness is a trait that is forcing him to expel things to the
                        end, in order to comply with the standards.
                    </p>

                        Expressive and quick-witted, Gemini represents two different sides of personality and you will never be sure with whom you will face. Gemini can be sociable,communicative and ready for fun, while on the other hand it can be very serious, thoughtful, restless

                        As an air sign, Gemini is concerned with all aspects of the mind. This zodiac sign is ruled by Mercury, which is a planet that represents communication, writing and teaching others. They get fascinated by almost everything in the world and they have a
                        feeling as if there is not enough time to experience everything they want to see. This makes them excellent artists, writers and journalists. Gemini sign means that sometimes people born under this sign have a feeling that their
                        other half is missing, so they are forever seeking for new friends, mentors and colleagues.

                        Deeply intuitive and sentimental, Cancer can be one of the most challenging Zodiac signs to get to know. Cancer is very emotional and sensitive, and they care about family and home. Cancer is sympathetic and is very attached to the people who surround

                    <p>
                        Because of the ruling planet the Moon, the many phases of its lunar cycle can deepen Cancers internal mysteries and create fleeting emotional patterns that the sensitive Cancer cannot control, especially when a child. This can show itself as mood swings,
                        selfishness, manipulation and fits of rage. Cancer is quick to help others and avoid conflicts. One of his greatest strengths is persistent determination. Cancer doesn't have great ambitions, because they are happy and content
                        to have a loving family and tranquil and harmonious home. They often take good care of their co-workers and treat them as family.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Leo is a fire sign, which means that he loves life and expects to have a good time. Like other fire signs, Sagittarius and Aries, Leo is also able to use his mind to solve even the most difficult problems and take the initiative in solving various complicated
                        situations.

                    <p>
                        Ruled by the Sun, Leo worships the Sun in all is forms which is also a metaphorical expression of the state of his ego. This can be good, because Leos can easily search for what they need. But, on the other hand it can be problematic when Leos ignore
                        the problems and needs of others in order to fulfill their desires.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Problems can arise, when Leo becomes too fond of his achievements. This zodiac sign can also be arrogant, lazy and inflexible, because he assumes that someone else will clean up after him. A healthy sense of humor can make the collaboration with other
                        people, easier.
